**Type: Technical Meeting**

### About the Company Landing Page

* Ensure all team members know about the urgency of getting this working
* Inform the need for 3 variants for this product
  * general one (mostly informative)
  * technical one (mostly technical for software/data specialists)
  * corporate one (mostly for investors, fund rising etc...)

*these 3 variants can be different and even not share the same UX etc...*

* Leonel will try a new tech (recommended by others devs), called Bulma, a simple CSS framework, in order to replace Materializecss for presenting the content. **[due Sept 05]**

- Update homepage
  - create a new component to show the technologies used, and use a different way to show the info, logo full color, maybe small descriptive text
  - try some variants to use better the color palette:
    - use blue based nav bg color
    - use white as predominant color
    - separate sections using some of the secondary colors in palette
- All website
  - use yellow based (contrast color) in more elements, specially
  - Check how does the layout work in all devices
- Review Privacy Policy texts
- Find a way to share all account credentials **[pending]**
