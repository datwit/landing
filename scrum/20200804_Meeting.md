\### About the Company Landing Page



- We need to try several profiles (themes) to see and evaluate the different color palettes proposed by Enma. **[pending]** *(this should be done by configuring Vega's JSON response object to browser)*
- Try to add some yellow, maybe in some call to action elements and other sections. **[done]** *(works OK)*
- Update homepage
  - create a new component to show the technologies used, and use a different way to show the info, logo full color, maybe small descriptive text. **[in progress]** *(there is a first approach)*
  - move some sections to the top of the page and try to give more importance to some contents. **[done]** *(will be a final approval on this)*
- Check how does the layout work in all devices. **[in progress]**
- Review Terms and Condition and Privacy Policy texts. **[done T&C]** *(pending PP)*
- Find a way to share all account credentials **[pending]**
